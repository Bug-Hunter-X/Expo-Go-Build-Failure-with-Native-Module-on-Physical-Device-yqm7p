The issue stemmed from an incorrect configuration within the native module's Android manifest file.  The module needed specific permissions declared. Adding these permissions resolved the compatibility issue and allowed the app to build successfully. The necessary permissions varied based on the specific features and function of the native module.  The solution involved updating the `AndroidManifest.xml` file within the native module's directory, specifically adding the following permission:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

This ensures that the native module has access to required system resources which were implicitly denied in the Expo Go environment without explicit permissions.  Remember to ensure all necessary permissions are listed; the example permission is merely illustrative.
