While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo Go and a specific native module.  The error message wasn't particularly clear, but it suggested a problem with the module's initialization or linking process within the Expo Go environment. The error only appeared when running the app on a physical device using Expo Go, not during development on the simulator or web.
